Following a systematic review of published studies and a structured appraisal process, recommendations were developed to guide physical therapists and other health care clinicians in their intervention selection. Overall, clinical practice recommendations were formulated based on the evidence for each intervention and were assigned a grade based on the strength of the evidence. The evidence for each specific intervention was synthesized and appraised by lymphedema stage, when the information was available. In an effort to make recommendations clinically applicable, they were presented by modality throughout the care trajectory. Methodology and research populations varied significantly across studies, and it will be important for future research to use standardized definitions for participant characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and interventions.',\n",

(See Table 1 for overview of recommendations.)

For this CPG, a diagnosis of lymphedema was considered when present at a time point greater than 3\\xa0months postsurgical management to differentiate from postoperative swelling. Although this CPG was initially intended to address all upper quadrant lymphedema, a lack of clinical trials in populations other than breast cancer required the limitation of this CPG to BCRL.

(Grade C) Intervention for subclinical lymphedema may include education, self-massage, and use of compression garments.

(Grade A)•\\u2002If first-line treatment is not successful for early lymphedema, then CDT may be recommended. (Grade B)•\\u2002Compression (garment or bandaging) should be tailored for the individual’s lymphedema stage and impairments, in consultation with the patient. (Grade A) Moderate and Late Lymphedema (ISL Stages II and III):CDT should be used to reduce limb volume in those diagnosed with moderate and late BCRL. (Grade B)•\\u2002Compression bandaging and exercise are key components of CDT and should be used. (Grade A)•\\u2002Modifying CDT, specifically shortening or omitting the MLD component, may yield similar results on long-term volume reduction. (Grade B)•\\u2002In all treatment phases, compression interventions should be tailored for the individual’s lymphedema stage, impairments, and preferences. (Grade A)•\\u2002Kinesiotape may reduce volume but cannot be recommended to replace short-stretch compression bandaging in stage II and III BCRL. (Grade B) If kinesiotape is used in BCRL, clinicians should closely monitor for adverse events. (Grade B)•\\u2002Once a stable volume reduction is achieved with phase I clinical treatment, a program of home care including self-MLD, individually fitted compression garment, appropriate nightly compression if indicated, and exercise should be recommended. (Grade B)•\\u2002Use of a standard or advanced intermittent pneumatic compression device may be considered in phase II home care treatment. (Grade C)•\\u2002Monitoring for volume changes with follow-up care may be an important component for optimal long-term volume reduction. (Grade C) Low-level laser therapy may be considered either in combination with compression or CDT in patients with established lymphedema of the upper extremity. (Grade B)For All Stages (ISL Stages 0–III) in Relation to Other Therapeutic Modalities:The addition of myofascial therapy to stretching, exercise, and scar massage may be safe in patients greater than 3\\xa0months post–radiation therapy who are at risk for BCRL. (Grade C)Acupuncture has insufficient evidence to support use for volume reduction. (Grade C)\\n',\n",

Although many other impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions can occur in individuals impacted by BCRL, this CPG was constructed to identify interventions that impact the core impairment of increased interstitial fluid and overall limb volume. In concordance with a CPG for diagnostic measures, volume measures or bioelectric impedance spectroscopy (BIS) were determined as the current best standard for diagnosing and measuring the effectiveness of lymphedema treatments on increased interstitial fluid. Other impairments and activity restrictions related to BCRL, such as pain and decreased QOL, exist and should be addressed by clinicians.

Lacomba et al (II) demonstrated that an early (3–5\\xa0days post–hospital discharge) MLD (Leduc), exercise, and education program is better than education alone. Because of the study design, the benefit of exercise versus MLD could not be determined. Devoogdt et al (II) investigated if the addition of MLD (Vodder or LeDuc) post–drain removal to a program consisting of exercise, mobilization, stretching, scapular stabilization, and scar massage improved outcomes. MLD did not provide additional benefit to their control intervention, as lymphedema incidence was not significantly different between groups at 60\\xa0months (relative risk\\xa0=\\xa01.08; 95% CI\\xa0=\\xa00.74–1.58). Ochalek et al (II) randomly assigned women post-ALND to compression (fitted, circular knit, 15–21\\xa0mmHg) or no compression postoperatively.

The authors reported significantly less edema (P\\xa0<\\xa0.001) at 12\\xa0months in the compression group.

Tab. 2). Instead of risk reduction interventions, such as providing compression garments to all patients, PSMs follow patients over time to detect subclinical lymphedema and intervene when specific thresholds are met. Most studies reported completing a preoperative measure, followed by postoperative measurement every 3\\xa0months until 1\\xa0year and then biannually for up to 5\\xa0years. In the included literature investigating the PSM, all studies were rated as low quality either due to a retrospective chart review study design or due to lack of randomization influencing bias ratings. All studies, except for Kaufman et al (III), investigated patient groups where most or all participants had ALND and thus were at higher risk. Other high-risk groups included populations receiving axillary node radiation and taxane chemotherapy. In all PSM studies, interventions were initiated when subclinical lymphedema was detected either by BIS L-Dex scores of ≥10 or a 3% increase from preoperative volume using perometry (Suppl. Tab. 2). Studies used a compression garment and education for subclinical lymphedema and reserved CDT for those with lymphedema that persisted or progressed. Other interventions for subclinical lymphedema in these trials included self-massage and short-term “physical therapy.”',\n",

In addition, the investigators provided comprehensive education to all participants. When an individual had a BIS L-Dex score of >10\\xa0units consistent with subclinical lymphedema, self-massage and compression garments were initiated. If lymphedema persisted for more than 4\\xa0weeks or progressed, further intervention was recommended. Using this model of care, 34% of the population was found to have subclinical BCRL, of which 82% could be managed with this conservative treatment alone. According to Koelmeyer et al, identification of BCRL with BIS occurred significantly earlier in a PSM group than a traditional referral group. Although they found no reduction in the number of treatment sessions between groups when BCRL did occur, the traditional referral group was more likely to be diagnosed with lymphedema of greater severity (stages II and III, 24% traditional vs 4% PSM). Similarly, Stout Gergich et al (III) described a PSM where women were fitted with a compression garment (ready-made, fitted, 20–30\\xa0mmHg) if a\\xa0>3% limb volume change occurred. The duration of the intervention was 4.4\\xa0weeks on average. At follow-up, which occurred at a mean of 4.8\\xa0months, a 4.1% volume decrease was maintained.

Mazor et al (III) enrolled women at risk for BCRL in a weekly Ashtanga yoga program for 8\\xa0weeks. Individuals were instructed in poses to emphasize upper body strength and flexibility while minimizing dependent positions. Volume reduction occurred but was not statistically significant (P\\xa0=\\xa0.40). Lai et al (III) reported insignificant volume differences (P\\xa0=\\xa0.76) following a 12-week aerobic yoga program 3 times per week for 60\\xa0minutes in individuals at risk for BCRL. Douglas et al (III) reported that 90-minute weekly sessions of Satayanda yoga was safe for individuals with BCRL and yielded a slight volume reduction (BIS: 14.3%; perometry: 9.8%). The sessions incorporated modified poses, breathing exercises, meditation, and restricted static positions. Loudon et al (lII) measured the effects of Satayanda yoga as compared to usual self-care in women with BCRL. After 8\\xa0weeks, the yoga group had less tissue induration (P\\xa0=\\xa0.05), although no volume changes were reported between groups. At 1-month follow-up, volume increased more in the control versus the yoga group (P\\xa0=\\xa0.03). None of the studies investigated compression garment use during yoga.',\n",

Following a systematic review of published studies and a structured appraisal process, recommendations were developed to guide physical therapists and other health care clinicians in their intervention selection. Overall, clinical practice recommendations were formulated based on the evidence for each intervention and were assigned a grade based on the strength of the evidence. The evidence for each specific intervention was synthesized and appraised by lymphedema stage, when the information was available. In an effort to make recommendations clinically applicable, they were presented by modality throughout the care trajectory. Methodology and research populations varied significantly across studies, and it will be important for future research to use standardized definitions for participant characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and interventions.',\n",

Evidence-based recommendations, based on an individual’s clinical presentation, are needed to guide the clinician’s decision when recommending interventions. (See Table 1 for overview of recommendations.) The lymphedema staging model used for this clinical practice guideline (CPG) is an adaptation of the International Society of Lymphology (ISL) staging criteria (Tab. 2). For this CPG, a diagnosis of lymphedema was considered when present at a time point greater than 3\\xa0months postsurgical management to differentiate from postoperative swelling. Although this CPG was initially intended to address all upper quadrant lymphedema, a lack of clinical trials in populations other than breast cancer required the limitation of this CPG to BCRL. Specifically, this CPG identified interventions targeting volume reduction as a direct impact on upper extremity BCRL due to limitations in diagnostic measurements of the trunk and chest.',\n",

(Best Practice)Individually tailored exercises should be included postoperatively and gradually progressed. (Grade B)In individuals who have undergone axillary lymph node dissection:•\\u2002The addition of therapist-provided manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) to the postoperative care plan may not reduce the risk of developing BCRL. (Grade C) •\\u2002Provision of a fitted compression garment to patients at high risk of developing lymphedema, when paired with upper extremity exercise and diaphragmatic breathing, may reduce development of lymphedema. (Grade B)\\nProspective Surveillance Model and Identified Subclinical (ISL Stage 0) Lymphedema\\tEarly identification of subclinical lymphedema in high-risk groups through prospective surveillance may improve outcomes. (Grade C)•\\u2002Monitoring with bioelectric impedance spectroscopy or volume measures may begin with a preoperative assessment, repeated every 3\\xa0months for the first year postoperatively, and then biannually for up to 5\\xa0years. (Grade C) Intervention for subclinical lymphedema may include education, self-massage, and use of compression garments. (Grade C)If early subclinical lymphedema persists or progresses after initial conservative intervention, individuals may benefit from more intensive interventions, such as complete decongestive therapy (CDT). (Grade C)\\nExercise for Individuals at Risk for or With Subclinical (ISL Stage 0) BCRL\\tProgressive resistance training is safe when an individualized program is supervised beginning at least 1 month postsurgery. (Grade A)Individualized aerobic exercise programs should be provided. (Grade A)Monitoring for exercise tolerance and adverse effects should initially occur at least weekly and then taper according to clinical presentation. (Grade A)\\nInterventions Recommended for Individuals Diagnosed With BCRL\\tEarly Lymphedema (ISL Stage I):If early signs and/or symptoms of lymphedema are noted, the patient should be individually fitted with a compression garment, instructed in an exercise program, and provided education as first-line treatment. (Grade A)•\\u2002If first-line treatment is not successful for early lymphedema, then CDT may be recommended. (Grade B)•\\u2002Compression (garment or bandaging) should be tailored for the individual’s lymphedema stage and impairments, in consultation with the patient. (Grade A) Moderate and Late Lymphedema (ISL Stages II and III):CDT should be used to reduce limb volume in those diagnosed with moderate and late BCRL. (Grade B)•\\u2002Compression bandaging and exercise are key components of CDT and should be used. (Grade A)•\\u2002Modifying CDT, specifically shortening or omitting the MLD component, may yield similar results on long-term volume reduction. (Grade B)•\\u2002In all treatment phases, compression interventions should be tailored for the individual’s lymphedema stage, impairments, and preferences. (Grade A)•\\u2002Kinesiotape may reduce volume but cannot be recommended to replace short-stretch compression bandaging in stage II and III BCRL. (Grade B) If kinesiotape is used in BCRL, clinicians should closely monitor for adverse events. (Grade B)•\\u2002Once a stable volume reduction is achieved with phase I clinical treatment, a program of home care including self-MLD, individually fitted compression garment, appropriate nightly compression if indicated, and exercise should be recommended. (Grade B)•\\u2002Use of a standard or advanced intermittent pneumatic compression device may be considered in phase II home care treatment. (Grade C)•\\u2002Monitoring for volume changes with follow-up care may be an important component for optimal long-term volume reduction. (Grade C) Low-level laser therapy may be considered either in combination with compression or CDT in patients with established lymphedema of the upper extremity. (Grade B)For All Stages (ISL Stages 0–III) in Relation to Other Therapeutic Modalities:The addition of myofascial therapy to stretching, exercise, and scar massage may be safe in patients greater than 3\\xa0months post–radiation therapy who are at risk for BCRL. (Grade C)Acupuncture has insufficient evidence to support use for volume reduction. (Grade C)\\n',\n",

A single article was then reviewed individually and verified to have ≥90% agreement on quality criteria with the GDG’s rating before a reviewer was included. Two reviewers then independently appraised each article, and, if consensus on a quality rating could not be achieved, a third was used. All articles were reviewed by at least 1 GDG member. The CAT-EI, which assesses the risk of bias in clinical research, was used to assign a quality rating based on the APTA CPG manual.

Most studies reported completing a preoperative measure, followed by postoperative measurement every 3\\xa0months until 1\\xa0year and then biannually for up to 5\\xa0years. In the included literature investigating the PSM, all studies were rated as low quality either due to a retrospective chart review study design or due to lack of randomization influencing bias ratings. All studies, except for Kaufman et al (III), investigated patient groups where most or all participants had ALND and thus were at higher risk. Other high-risk groups included populations receiving axillary node radiation and taxane chemotherapy. In all PSM studies, interventions were initiated when subclinical lymphedema was detected either by BIS L-Dex scores of ≥10 or a 3% increase from preoperative volume using perometry (Suppl. Tab. 2). Studies used a compression garment and education for subclinical lymphedema and reserved CDT for those with lymphedema that persisted or progressed.

In a subsequent study, Ridner et al evaluated the use of APC for management of individuals with stage II BCRL without truncal edema. The authors compared APC to the trunk, chest, and arm versus the arm only. Both groups experienced a statistically significant volume reduction (P\\xa0=\\xa0.02) with no adverse events. However, there was no difference in volume reduction between groups (P\\xa0=\\xa0.48). The authors concluded there may be no advantage to treating the trunk with APC in the absence of truncal edema.',\n",

The overall incidence rate varies because of differences in diagnostic measures and oncologic management. DiSipio et al reported an overall BCRL incidence rate of 16.6% (95% CI\\xa0=\\xa013.6–20.2) in individuals 3\\xa0months to 20\\xa0years after diagnosis. People who are post–axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) have an increased incidence at 19.9% (95% CI\\xa0=\\xa013.5–28.2). This incidence rate suggests that 1 in 5 survivors may develop BCRL. In 87.1% to 89% of individuals who develop BCRL, diagnosis occurs within 2 or 3\\xa0years postsurgery. Individuals receiving sentinel lymph node biopsy, a more recent management technique, demonstrated a BCRL incidence from 0% to 63.4% at 6 to 12\\xa0months, indicating that BCRL continues to be an issue.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Interventions for cancer-related lymphedema are needed at various time points along the clinical trajectory, beginning at diagnosis of breast cancer and continuing through cancer treatments and survivorship. Evidence-based recommendations, based on an individual’s clinical presentation, are needed to guide the clinician’s decision when recommending interventions. (See Table 1 for overview of recommendations.) The lymphedema staging model used for this clinical practice guideline (CPG) is an adaptation of the International Society of Lymphology (ISL) staging criteria (Tab. 2). For this CPG, a diagnosis of lymphedema was considered when present at a time point greater than 3\\xa0months postsurgical management to differentiate from postoperative swelling. Although this CPG was initially intended to address all upper quadrant lymphedema, a lack of clinical trials in populations other than breast cancer required the limitation of this CPG to BCRL. Specifically, this CPG identified interventions targeting volume reduction as a direct impact on upper extremity BCRL due to limitations in diagnostic measurements of the trunk and chest.',\n",

Although many other impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions can occur in individuals impacted by BCRL, this CPG was constructed to identify interventions that impact the core impairment of increased interstitial fluid and overall limb volume. In concordance with a CPG for diagnostic measures, volume measures or bioelectric impedance spectroscopy (BIS) were determined as the current best standard for diagnosing and measuring the effectiveness of lymphedema treatments on increased interstitial fluid. Other impairments and activity restrictions related to BCRL, such as pain and decreased QOL, exist and should be addressed by clinicians. Clinicians should consider the evidence provided in this guideline along with the individual’s clinical presentation, patient preferences, and goals when determining an appropriate plan of care.',\n",

       "   'text': 'A work group from the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) Academy of Oncologic Physical Therapy developed a clinical practice guideline to aid clinicians in identifying interventions for people with breast cancer–related lymphedema, targeting volume reduction, beginning at breast cancer diagnosis and continuing through cancer treatments and survivorship. Following a systematic review of published studies and a structured appraisal process, recommendations were developed to guide physical therapists and other health care clinicians in their intervention selection. Overall, clinical practice recommendations were formulated based on the evidence for each intervention and were assigned a grade based on the strength of the evidence. The evidence for each specific intervention was synthesized and appraised by lymphedema stage, when the information was available. In an effort to make recommendations clinically applicable, they were presented by modality throughout the care trajectory. Methodology and research populations varied significantly across studies, and it will be important for future research to use standardized definitions for participant characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and interventions.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Interventions for cancer-related lymphedema are needed at various time points along the clinical trajectory, beginning at diagnosis of breast cancer and continuing through cancer treatments and survivorship. Evidence-based recommendations, based on an individual’s clinical presentation, are needed to guide the clinician’s decision when recommending interventions. (See Table 1 for overview of recommendations.) The lymphedema staging model used for this clinical practice guideline (CPG) is an adaptation of the International Society of Lymphology (ISL) staging criteria (Tab. 2). For this CPG, a diagnosis of lymphedema was considered when present at a time point greater than 3\\xa0months postsurgical management to differentiate from postoperative swelling. Although this CPG was initially intended to address all upper quadrant lymphedema, a lack of clinical trials in populations other than breast cancer required the limitation of this CPG to BCRL. Specifically, this CPG identified interventions targeting volume reduction as a direct impact on upper extremity BCRL due to limitations in diagnostic measurements of the trunk and chest.',\n",

(Best Practice)Individually tailored exercises should be included postoperatively and gradually progressed. (Grade B)In individuals who have undergone axillary lymph node dissection:•\\u2002The addition of therapist-provided manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) to the postoperative care plan may not reduce the risk of developing BCRL. (Grade C) •\\u2002Provision of a fitted compression garment to patients at high risk of developing lymphedema, when paired with upper extremity exercise and diaphragmatic breathing, may reduce development of lymphedema. (Grade B)\\nProspective Surveillance Model and Identified Subclinical (ISL Stage 0) Lymphedema\\tEarly identification of subclinical lymphedema in high-risk groups through prospective surveillance may improve outcomes. (Grade C)•\\u2002Monitoring with bioelectric impedance spectroscopy or volume measures may begin with a preoperative assessment, repeated every 3\\xa0months for the first year postoperatively, and then biannually for up to 5\\xa0years. (Grade C) Intervention for subclinical lymphedema may include education, self-massage, and use of compression garments. (Grade C)If early subclinical lymphedema persists or progresses after initial conservative intervention, individuals may benefit from more intensive interventions, such as complete decongestive therapy (CDT). (Grade C)\\nExercise for Individuals at Risk for or With Subclinical (ISL Stage 0) BCRL\\tProgressive resistance training is safe when an individualized program is supervised beginning at least 1 month postsurgery. (Grade A)Individualized aerobic exercise programs should be provided. (Grade A)Monitoring for exercise tolerance and adverse effects should initially occur at least weekly and then taper according to clinical presentation. (Grade A)\\nInterventions Recommended for Individuals Diagnosed With BCRL\\tEarly Lymphedema (ISL Stage I):If early signs and/or symptoms of lymphedema are noted, the patient should be individually fitted with a compression garment, instructed in an exercise program, and provided education as first-line treatment. (Grade A)•\\u2002If first-line treatment is not successful for early lymphedema, then CDT may be recommended. (Grade B)•\\u2002Compression (garment or bandaging) should be tailored for the individual’s lymphedema stage and impairments, in consultation with the patient. (Grade A) Moderate and Late Lymphedema (ISL Stages II and III):CDT should be used to reduce limb volume in those diagnosed with moderate and late BCRL. (Grade B)•\\u2002Compression bandaging and exercise are key components of CDT and should be used. (Grade A)•\\u2002Modifying CDT, specifically shortening or omitting the MLD component, may yield similar results on long-term volume reduction. (Grade B)•\\u2002In all treatment phases, compression interventions should be tailored for the individual’s lymphedema stage, impairments, and preferences. (Grade A)•\\u2002Kinesiotape may reduce volume but cannot be recommended to replace short-stretch compression bandaging in stage II and III BCRL. (Grade B) If kinesiotape is used in BCRL, clinicians should closely monitor for adverse events. (Grade B)•\\u2002Once a stable volume reduction is achieved with phase I clinical treatment, a program of home care including self-MLD, individually fitted compression garment, appropriate nightly compression if indicated, and exercise should be recommended. (Grade B)•\\u2002Use of a standard or advanced intermittent pneumatic compression device may be considered in phase II home care treatment. (Grade C)•\\u2002Monitoring for volume changes with follow-up care may be an important component for optimal long-term volume reduction. (Grade C) Low-level laser therapy may be considered either in combination with compression or CDT in patients with established lymphedema of the upper extremity. (Grade B)For All Stages (ISL Stages 0–III) in Relation to Other Therapeutic Modalities:The addition of myofascial therapy to stretching, exercise, and scar massage may be safe in patients greater than 3\\xa0months post–radiation therapy who are at risk for BCRL. (Grade C)Acupuncture has insufficient evidence to support use for volume reduction. (Grade C)\\n',\n",

Although many other impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions can occur in individuals impacted by BCRL, this CPG was constructed to identify interventions that impact the core impairment of increased interstitial fluid and overall limb volume. In concordance with a CPG for diagnostic measures, volume measures or bioelectric impedance spectroscopy (BIS) were determined as the current best standard for diagnosing and measuring the effectiveness of lymphedema treatments on increased interstitial fluid. Other impairments and activity restrictions related to BCRL, such as pain and decreased QOL, exist and should be addressed by clinicians.

Most studies reported completing a preoperative measure, followed by postoperative measurement every 3\\xa0months until 1\\xa0year and then biannually for up to 5\\xa0years. In the included literature investigating the PSM, all studies were rated as low quality either due to a retrospective chart review study design or due to lack of randomization influencing bias ratings.

Other high-risk groups included populations receiving axillary node radiation and taxane chemotherapy. In all PSM studies, interventions were initiated when subclinical lymphedema was detected either by BIS L-Dex scores of ≥10 or a 3% increase from preoperative volume using perometry (Suppl. Tab. 2). Studies used a compression garment and education for subclinical lymphedema and reserved CDT for those with lymphedema that persisted or progressed.

Although they found no reduction in the number of treatment sessions between groups when BCRL did occur, the traditional referral group was more likely to be diagnosed with lymphedema of greater severity (stages II and III, 24% traditional vs 4% PSM).

In phase II, care typically includes: skin care, exercises, self-MLD, and use of compression therapy. In the studies reviewed, there were variations in CDT components, such as different MLD approaches and compression systems.

A significant but often overlooked component of caring for breast cancer patients is survivorship care, provided after the completion of active treatment in order to facilitate transition into the next surveillance phase.

Some long-term issues patients may face include ongoing pain, fatigue, lymphedema, heart disease, difficulty sleeping, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, stress, and financial issues.

According to CPAC, about 67.7% of patients face physical, emotional and practical challenges after treatment completion\\xa0. Most cancer survivors need someone to talk to about concerns, and more information about how to address them. Often, patients are not able to get help and if they do, 34% of them wait more than three months to receive it. Many times, information received is not useful. Thus, it is evident that more comprehensive care is required for cancer survivors and we must do better to serve Canadians.\\xa0',\n",

Staff found that it was difficult incorporating these sessions into very busy, unpredictable schedules and coordinating all of the survivorship sessions. Unstructured timing and scheduling of the sessions was one of the challenges faced by staff when striving to complete them. In addition, a lack of staff, space and time resources available proved to be a barrier for the trialed workflows. More detailed results on the staff evaluation are discussed in an accompanying paper (Unpublished data: Malam S, Lawrence B, Bradley C, et al.

       "   'text': 'There were a number of limitations to this study. First, the pilot included only one format for education delivery. The feasibility and response to group sessions were not tested. Participant preference for delivery format was partly based on perceptions of what they thought a group session would be like. In addition, not all participants returned an evaluation form at session completion. Moreover, due to time and staffing constraints, multiple attempts to reach participants over the phone were not viable in this study. Thus, we cannot know if the results would have been altered if all participants in the study had provided feedback, whether written or over the phone. The responses were also kept anonymous; therefore we cannot be certain that 45% of participants who were reached in the follow-up phone calls were not fully encompassed in the 56% of participating survey respondents. Furthermore, any lifestyle changes made post-treatment may not be directly due to the survivorship program and could be due to a multitude of other contributing factors. Finally, there were some logistical limitations that may have affected the effectiveness of the study, such as language barriers and scheduling conflicts among\\xa0some participants.\\xa0',\n",

The plan would be to initially target breast cancer patients completing radiation treatment, with the plan to eventually roll out to all patients receiving dose radiation therapy with a curative intent. The information pamphlet and presentation will require some revision, as current content is tailored specifically for breast cancer patients. More general follow-up information will need to be adopted for other cancer sites. Additionally, appropriate workflow will need to be identified in order to implement this program department wide. This includes workflow processes for appointment scheduling, location, and staff scheduling in order to accommodate all of the survivorship sessions. This initiative will also help the cancer centre collaborate with community programs to help create a seamless transition of care back to the community.

This study evaluated the applicability, effectiveness and feasibility of implementing a simple survivorship program into one Regional Cancer Centre. Delivering one-on-one education sessions to individual participants focusing on healthy lifestyle measures, garnered a positive response from participants, increasing their confidence and knowledge for making lifestyle improvements. Survivorship care has the ability to improve quality of life for patients post-treatment, which can lend itself to improved outcomes and overall survival. It enables patients to feel empowered and feel more in control of their lives. Having the ability to provide these sessions to patients completing their radiation therapy treatments proves to be an important aspect of a patient’s treatment journey and allows them to embrace their new normal after cancer.\\xa0',\n",

The survivorship program entailed a one on one education session delivered to breast cancer patients within the last two weeks of their radiation treatment. Participants were provided a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, information pamphlet, and evaluation form to provide feedback on materials and presentation. Survivorship education sessions were delivered by study staff or staff scheduled in the Pre-Radiotherapy Patient Assessment role. Follow-up phone calls were conducted post-session delivery to determine the ongoing applicability of survivorship material. Staff was also given an evaluation form upon completion of the trial to measure the session feasibility. Results Of the 124 participants in the study, 69 (56%) provided feedback. Results showed that 98% of participants felt the information provided either confirmed what they were already doing (44%) or encouraged them to consider a lifestyle change (54%). Additionally, 70% reported feeling more confident after completing the session. Staff survey results reported that 87.5% agreed or strongly agreed that these sessions were beneficial and valuable to patients Conclusions Delivering one-on-one education sessions to individual participants focusing on healthy lifestyle measures\\xa0garnered a positive response from participants, increasing their confidence and knowledge for making lifestyle changes. While staff survey results pointed strongly in favour of continuing with the survivorship sessions, it was shown that the methods of delivery trialed in this study were not feasible to be implemented on a larger scale. With some workflow modification, implementing a survivorship care program in our cancer centre is a possible and important aspect of a patient’s treatment journey.'"

       "' A work group from the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) Academy of Oncologic Physical Therapy developed a clinical practice guideline to aid clinicians in identifying interventions for people with breast cancer–related lymphedema, targeting volume reduction, beginning at breast cancer diagnosis and continuing through cancer treatments and survivorship. Following a systematic review of published studies and a structured appraisal process, recommendations were developed to guide physical therapists and other health care clinicians in their intervention selection. Overall, clinical practice recommendations were formulated based on the evidence for each intervention and were assigned a grade based on the strength of the evidence. The evidence for each specific intervention was synthesized and appraised by lymphedema stage, when the information was available. In an effort to make recommendations clinically applicable, they were presented by modality throughout the care trajectory. Methodology and research populations varied significantly across studies, and it will be important for future research to use standardized definitions for participant characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and interventions.'"

Following a systematic review of published studies and a structured appraisal process, recommendations were developed to guide physical therapists and other health care clinicians in their intervention selection. Overall, clinical practice recommendations were formulated based on the evidence for each intervention and were assigned a grade based on the strength of the evidence. The evidence for each specific intervention was synthesized and appraised by lymphedema stage, when the information was available. In an effort to make recommendations clinically applicable, they were presented by modality throughout the care trajectory. Methodology and research populations varied significantly across studies, and it will be important for future research to use standardized definitions for participant characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and interventions.'},\n",

This study was aimed to determine the trend of SPBC incidence over time and the risk of developing SPBC in site-specific primary cancer survivors in the United States. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 13 registry (1992–2015) was used to identify SPBC patients with previous malignancies. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was computed to compare the incidence rates of the observed cases of SPBC in cancer survivors over the expected cases in the general population. Elevated risk of SPBC was observed in women with previous BC (SIR = 1.74) or thyroid cancer (SIR = 1.17). Women with initial skin melanoma in older age (≥50 years) (SIR = 1.11), or White race (SIR = 1.11) presented an elevated incidence of SPBC than the general female population. Besides, Asian/Pacific Islander (API) women with cancer of corpus uteri, ovary, bladder, or kidney were prone to developing SPBC when compared with the general population, with SIRs of 1.61, 1.35, 1.48, and 1.70, respectively. Male BC patients showed profound risk of developing SPBC (SIR = 34.86). Male leukemia patients also presented elevated risk of developing SPBC (SIR = 2.06). Our study suggests significant increase of SPBC in both sexes in the United States. Elevated risk of SPBC exists in survivors with primary BC, female thyroid cancer, male leukemia, and API female cancer patients with primary genitourinary cancer. Our study is helpful in developing strategies for BC control and prevention on specific first primary cancer survivors with an elevated risk of SPBC.'},\n",

Fifty-two women with contralateral breast cancer and 153 women with unilateral breast cancer were identified within the Women’s Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study who were at increased risk of RCBC because they were ≤ 40 years of age at first diagnosis of breast cancer and received a scatter radiation dose > 1 Gy to the contralateral breast. A previously reported algorithm, preconditioned random forest regression, was applied to predict the risk of developing RCBC. The resulting model produced an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.62 (p = 0.04) on hold-out validation data. The biological analysis identified the cyclic AMP-mediated signaling and Ephrin-A as significant biological correlates, which were previously shown to influence cell survival after radiation in an ATM-dependent manner. The key connected genes and proteins that are identified in this analysis were previously identified as relevant to breast cancer, radiation response, or both. In summary, machine learning/bioinformatics methods applied to genome-wide genotyping data have great potential to reveal plausible biological correlates associated with the risk of RCBC.'},\n",

We report on a randomized trial to increase adherence to mammography screening guidelines among survivors and FDRs. From the Georgia Cancer Registry, breast cancer survivors diagnosed during 2000–2009 at six Georgia cancer centers underwent phone interviews about their breast cancer screening behaviors and their FDRs. Nonadherent survivors and FDRs meeting all inclusion criteria were randomized to high-intensity (evidence-based brochure, phone counseling, mailed reminders, and communications with primary care providers) or low-intensity interventions (brochure only). Three and 12-month follow-up questionnaires were completed. Data analyses used standard statistical approaches. Among 1055 survivors and 287 FDRs who were located, contacted, and agreed to participate, 59.5% and 62.7%, respectively, reported breast cancer screening in the past 12 months and were thus ineligible. For survivors enrolled at baseline (N = 95), the proportion reporting adherence to guideline screening by 12 months post-enrollment was similar in the high and low-intensity arms (66.7% vs. 79.2%, p = 0.31). Among FDRs enrolled at baseline (N = 83), screening was significantly higher in the high-intensity arm at 12 months (60.9% vs. 32.4%, p = 0.03). Overall, about 72% of study-eligible survivors (all of whom were screening nonadherent at baseline) reported screening within 12 months of study enrollment. For enrolled FDRs receiving the high-intensity intervention, over 60% reported guideline screening by 12 months.

Methods: This was a single-arm mixed-methods pilot study. Primary outcome measures were feasibility (recruitment, adherence) and safety. Validated self-report questionnaires were used to evaluate a constellation of interdependent symptoms, including pain, fatigue, mood, exercise, interoceptive awareness, and health-related quality of life at baseline and 12 weeks. A subset of the instruments was administered 6 months postintervention. Shoulder range of motion and grip strength were objectively assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. Qualitative interviews were conducted at baseline and 12 weeks. Results: Twenty-one participants were enrolled; 18 and 17 participants, respectively, completed the 12-week and 6-month outcome assessment. No serious adverse events were reported. Statistically significant improvements were observed at 12 weeks in pain severity and interference, fatigue, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, self-esteem, pain catastrophizing, and several subdomains of quality of life, interoceptive awareness, and shoulder range of motion. Changes in pain, fatigue, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, and quality of life were clinically meaningful. Postintervention effects were sustained at 6 months. Conclusions: QMBE is a safe and gentle multimodal intervention that shows promise in conferring a broad range of psychosocial and physical benefits for breast cancer survivors with PPSP.

Mobile technology, as an emerging method for changing health behaviors, is gaining attention from many researchers. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a mobile app-based community on enhancing PA and decreasing distress in breast cancer survivors. We conducted a non-randomized, prospective, interventional study that had a mobile community-later arm and mobile community-first arm. With an Android smartphone app (WalkON®), daily walk steps and weekly distress scores using app-based Distress Thermometer (DT) questionnaires were collected from participants for about 12 weeks. To examine the difference in weekly step counts before and during the community activity, we used a paired t-test method. For a comparative analysis, we referred to a previous prospective observational study without a mobile community intervention that had the same setting as the present study. After propensity score matching (PSM), multivariable regression modeling with difference-in-difference (DID) was performed to estimate the effect of the mobile app-based community on PA and mental distress. From January to August 2018, a total of 64 participants were enrolled in this study. In the univariate analysis, after participation in the mobile community, the participants showed a significant increase in total weekly steps (t = −3.5341; P = 0.00208). The mean of the differences was 10,408.72 steps. In the multivariate analysis after PSM, the mobile community significantly increased steps by 8,683.4 per week (p value <0.0001) and decreased DT scores by 0.77 per week (p value = 0.009) in the mixed effect model. In the two-way fixed effect model, the mobile community showed a significant increase in weekly steps by 8,723.4 (p value <0.0001) and decrease in weekly DT by 0.73 (p value = 0.013).

In this article, we assess the long-term efficacy of an 8-week training program in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on quality of life (QoL) in Hispanic BC survivors. Methods: Hispanic BC survivors, within the first 5 years of diagnosis, stages I to III BC, were recruited. Participants were enrolled in bilingual, 8-week intensive group training in MBSR and were asked to practice a- home, daily. They were also provided with audio recordings and a book on mindfulness practices. Patient-reported outcomes for QoL and distress were evaluated at baseline, and every 3 months, for 24 months. Results: Thirty-three self-identified Hispanic women with BC completed the MBSR program and were followed at 24 months. Statistically significant reduction was noted for the Generalized Anxiety Disorder measure (mean change −2.39, P=0.04); and Patient Health Questionnaire (mean change −2.27, P=0.04), at 24 months, compared with baseline.

The second author is the subject patient and a long-term survivor of systemic metastatic breast cancer with numerous brain metastases (corresponding to 8% survivor group). We credit her survival to a combination of (1) medicine as practiced by an excellent oncologist with whom we developed a partnership to manage the patient’s health, (2) our informed exploration of the available scientific knowledge including a review of scientific research articles that go beyond conventional care, and (3) the patient’s supplementation with numerous repurposed drugs and other substances reported to have antitumor properties. Alongside her conventional treatment (the medical standard of care), it seems likely that this supplementation has been a key factor in the patient’s long-term survival. We also point out that the lack of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging brain scans for early detection of brain metastases poses substantial risks for patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer in non–central nervous system locations. Thus, we suggest that research be conducted on such early detection for possible inclusion in the recommendations for the medical standard of care.

The approach included five steps: (a) information gathering and needs assessment; (b) preliminary design; (c) preliminary testing; (d) refinement; and (e) final trial. Key findings from the information gathering stage related to the need to take into account differences in ethnicity, religion, and beliefs about cancer. Discussions with experts indicated that particular words were not acceptable in Malay culture and that specific aspects were “taboo” (e.g., showing pictures of breasts in relation to breast cancer on TV). Stage 3 of the analysis revealed that the presentation of cancer survivors rather than health professionals on programme materials was preferred by Malaysians and that there was a poor level of awareness about colorectal cancer. The results were used systematically to adapt two culturally suitable cancer awareness mass media campaigns for implementation in Malaysia. The developed materials were in line with government priorities and took into account the local health care system structure. The establishment of a partnership with key stakeholders (e.g., the Ministry of Health and the lead patient advocacy organization) and the application of a systematic approach to address cultural factors and resource constraints contribute to the successful implementation of public health programmes in global health settings.'},\n",

Methods: Twenty-five female BCS undergoing hormone therapy were randomized into resistance training group (TG, n = 12) or control (CG, n = 13) group. The TG performed 8 weeks of supervised RT, with 1 trainer per volunteer, once a week. Body composition was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and muscle strength was evaluated by 10 repetition maximum (10 RM) for leg press (45°) and bench press exercises. A 1-way analysis of variance was used to compare within-group effects at pre- and post-intervention. An analysis of covariance test was used to compare post-intervention values, using pre-intervention measures as covariates. The effect size (ES) was calculated by Cohen’s d. Results: The TG improved muscle strength in 10 RM leg press (45°; Δ 33.75 ± 11.51 kg, P = .02; ES = 0.96) and bench press (Δ 4.08 ± 1.83 kg, P = .01; ES = 1.15).

To understand the determinants of cancer survival differentials between populations, researchers have often applied regression analysis. We here propose the use of a non-parametric decomposition method to quantify the exact contribution of specific components to the absolute difference in cancer survival between two populations. Survival differences are here decomposed into the contributions of differences in stage at diagnosis, population age structure, and stage-and-age-specific survival. We demonstrate the method with the example of differences in one-year and five-year breast cancer survival between Denmark’s five regions. Differences in stage at diagnosis explained 45% and 27%, respectively, of the one- and five-year survival differences between Zealand and Central Denmark for patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2010. We find that the introduced decomposition method provides a powerful complementary analysis and has several advantages compared with regression models: No structural or distributional assumptions are required; aggregated data can be used; and the use of absolute differences allows quantification of the survival that could be gained by improving, for example, stage at diagnosis relative to a reference population, thus feeding directly into health policy evaluation.'},\n",

Some breast cancer treatments including anthracyclines, trastuzumab and radiotherapy can increase the risk of CVD, especially for patients with pre-existing CVD risk factors. Early identification of patients at increased CVD risk may allow switching to less cardiotoxic treatments, active surveillance or treatment of CVD risk factors. One of the strongest independent CVD risk factors is the presence and extent of coronary artery calcifications (CAC). In clinical practice, CAC are generally quantified on ECG-triggered cardiac CT scans. Patients with breast cancer treated with radiotherapy routinely undergo radiotherapy planning CT scans of the chest, and those scans could provide the opportunity to routinely assess CAC before a potentially cardiotoxic treatment. The Bragatston study aims to investigate the association between calcifications in the coronary arteries, aorta and heart valves (hereinafter called ‘cardiovascular calcifications’) measured automatically on planning CT scans of patients with breast cancer and CVD risk.'},\n",

European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires—Core30 and BR23 (EORTC QLQ-C30 & BR23) were used to assess QoL in breast cancer survivors. ANOVA and independent t-test (parametric tests) were used for the categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests used for non-parametric tests. Linear regression analysis was done to measure predictors’ significance and to calculate the coefficient of determination. Two hundred and eighty-four patients completed the survey. Global health status and functional scales, in most of the domains, were high, while symptom scales were moderate-to-low for most items, showing better QoL. Insomnia and fatigue were the most disturbing symptoms. Patients exhibited higher scores for body image and future perspective, while the least score is for sexual functioning. Global health, physical functioning, and role functioning were better in the age group ≤50 years (p<0.05). Premenopausal and perimenopausal patients showed a better level of functioning as compared to postmenopausal patients (p = 0.001). Premenopausal patients scored higher for sexual enjoyment, as compared to peri- and post-menopausal patients (p = 0.04). Systemic therapy side effects were more evident in the breast conservative surgery group. Predictors explained 8% of the variation in Physical functioning (R-squared = 0.08).

Methods: Female overweight and obese cancer survivors (N = 51; mean age = 57.92 ± 10.04; 88% breast cancer history; 96% white) were randomized to one of two 10-week study treatment conditions: (a) exercise and nutrition counseling or (b) exercise and nutrition counseling plus the MORE intervention. Trial feasibility was assessed via recruitment and retention metrics. Measures of therapeutic mechanisms included self-reported interoceptive awareness, maladaptive eating behaviors, and savoring, as well as natural reward responsiveness and food attentional bias, which were evaluated as psychophysiological mechanisms. Results: Feasibility was demonstrated by 82% of participants who initiated MORE receiving a full dose of the intervention. Linear mixed models revealed that the addition of MORE led to significantly greater increases in indices of interoceptive awareness, savoring, and natural reward responsiveness, and, significantly greater decreases in external eating behaviors and food attentional bias—the latter of which was significantly associated with decreases in waist-to-hip ratio. Path analysis demonstrated that the effect of MORE on reducing food attentional bias was mediated by increased zygomatic electromyographic activation during attention to natural rewards. Conclusions and Implications: MORE may target appetitive dysregulatory mechanisms implicated in obesity by promoting interoceptive awareness and restructuring reward responsiveness.'},\n",

Although age-standardized incidence rate of BC and CC in Iran is low, the mortality to incidence ratio is high due to late diagnosis. Except an old and a quite comprehensive cancer registry, women’s cancer care encounter many challenges in Iran. Lack of a customized national and inclusive protocol to control cancer care along with the fragmented health system is the first and foremost cancer care challenge. Many high-risk women miss the opportunity of early diagnosis and treatment because of poor knowledge, low accessibility, or affordability to health care, stigma, and spouse negligence. Although the most effective BC screening method is mammography, it is not equally available for all Iranian women. Furthermore, the cost of BC is very high and screening is accompanied by stigmatized sociocultural beliefs. Unfortunately, while Iran has a good primary care system, low coverage of clinical breast examination and poor knowledge of women indicate that this system has not operated effective. Also due to the limited resources, the Pap smear test has not been applied to the majority of Iranian women. Despite the high basic health insurance coverage in Iran, it does not cover diagnostic test and full treatment of cancers which intensified underutilization of cancer care. In conclusion, developing a national policy and guideline for full coverage of early diagnosis of BC or CC should be prioritized. In this regard, health insurance companies should be committed to including BC and CC screening and care for their basic service packages. The second strategy could be training skillful, responsible, and motivated health-care providers. They are able to decrease the stigmatized view of doing mammography.

Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes.'},\n",

Methods: This report describes vitamin D supplement use by 553 breast cancer patient/survivors (193 who used a naturopathic oncology [NO] provider and 360 who did not) participating in a matched cohort study of breast cancer outcomes. Results: We found that more than half of breast cancer patients reported using vitamin D supplements. Women who received care from NO providers in early survivorship may be more likely to use vitamin D supplements (P < .05). Approximately 30% of breast cancer patients with blood levels recorded in their medical chart were potentially vitamin D deficient (<30 ng/mL). Vitamin D supplement use at study enrollment was associated with higher levels of self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at enrollment (P < .05) and predicted better HRQOL at 6-month follow-up (P < .05). Sufficient blood levels of vitamin D recorded between enrollment and follow-up were also associated with better HRQOL at follow-up (P < .05). Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation by breast cancer patients is common both during and after treatment for breast cancer, but deficiency may also be common. NO and conventional providers may be able to promote vitamin D sufficiency through vitamin D supplementation and by encouraging healthy solar exposure. Further studies should be undertaken examining whether vitamin D supplementation and higher blood levels might improve HRQOL among women with breast cancer in early survivorship.'},\n",

Furthermore, to examine the effects of physical job demands on these associations. Methods Data from a feasibility study on a multidisciplinary intervention to enhance return to work in patients with\\xa0cancer receiving\\xa0chemotherapy was used. Fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory) and perceived work ability (first item of the Work Ability Index) were assessed at baseline, and after 6, 12, and 18 months. Change scores (S1, S2, S3) from each assessment to the next were calculated, thus encompassing three separate time periods of 6 months. Regression analyses were used to quantify associations between change of perceived work ability and (model 1) change of general fatigue, and (model 2) change of mental and physical fatigue for each 6-month period separately. For model 2, interaction effects of perceived physical job demands were studied. Results A total of 89 participants were included for analysis, among which 84% with a diagnosis of breast cancer. On average, in model 1, a reduction of five points on general fatigue was associated with an improvement of one point in perceived work ability in all three 6-month periods. Model 2 showed, similarly, that change of physical fatigue (S1 and S2: B\\u2009=\\u2009−\\u20090.225; p\\u2009<\\u2009.001 and B\\u2009=\\u2009−\\u20090.162; p\\u2009=\\u2009.012) and change of mental fatigue (S3: B\\u2009=\\u2009−\\u20090.177; p\\u2009=\\u2009.027) were significantly inversely associated with change of perceived work ability.

A systems science approach, investigating these many influences, is needed to capture the complexity and multidimensionality of obesity prevention to improve health. Leveraging baseline data from a unique clinical cohort comprising 333 postmenopausal overweight or obese breast cancer survivors participating in a weight-loss trial, we applied Bayesian networks, a machine learning approach, to infer interrelationships between lifestyle factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity), body mass index (BMI), and health outcomes (biomarkers and self-reported quality of life metrics). We used bootstrap resampling to assess network stability and accuracy, and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) to compare networks. Our results identified important behavioral subnetworks. BMI was the primary pathway linking behavioral factors to glucose regulation and inflammatory markers; the BMI-biomarker link was reproduced in 100% of resampled networks. Sleep quality was a hub impacting mental quality of life and physical health with > 95% resampling reproducibility. Omission of the BMI or sleep links significantly degraded the fit of the networks. Our findings suggest potential mechanistic pathways and useful intervention targets for future trials.

Our objective was to explore if cognitive function in breast cancer survivors (BCS) differs by serum carotenoid concentrations, and if blood carotenoids concentrations are associated with reduced systemic inflammation. Methods: Objective cognitive function and perceived cognitive impairment of 29 BCS and 38 controls were assessed cross-sectionally with the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery and The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function Questionnaire, respectively. Serum carotenoid and inflammatory marker (sTNF-RII, IL-6, IL-1ra, CRP) concentrations were measured. Results: Low-carotenoid BCS had more cognitive complaints compared to the low-carotenoid controls (Mdiff = −43.0, p < 0.001) and high-carotenoid controls (Mdiff = −44.5, p < 0.001). However, the cognitive complaints of high-carotenoid BCS were intermediate to and not different than the low-carotenoid BCS, or low- or high-carotenoid controls. BCS performed similarly to controls on all objective cognitive measures. Multiple linear regression, controlling for age and body mass index (BMI), demonstrated an inverse association between serum carotenoid concentrations and pro-inflammatory sTNFR-II (β = 0.404, p = 0.005) and IL-6 concentrations (β =\\u2009−0.35, p = 0.001), but not IL-1ra or CRP. Conclusions: Higher serum carotenoid concentrations may convey cognitive and anti-inflammatory benefits in BCS.

HIIT improves endothelial function in non-cancer populations by decreasing oxidative stress, the main contributor to anthracycline-induced vascular dysfunction.

       "  'passage_text': 'Background: Among women in China, gynecological cancers are the second most common cancers after breast cancer. Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) has emerged as a significant problem affecting gynecological cancer survivors. While acupuncture has been used in different aspects of cancer care, the possible positive effects of acupuncture on cognitive impairment have received little attention. This study hypothesized that patients would demonstrate lower neurocognitive performance and lower structural connectivity compared to healthy controls. This pilot study also hypothesized that acupuncture may potentially be effective in treating CRCI of cancer patients by increasing brain structural connectivity and integrity. Methods: This prospective cohort study consisted of 3 stages: the first stage included a group of gynecological cancer patients and a group of age-matched healthy controls. This baseline stage used a core set of neurocognitive tests to screen patients with cognitive impairment and used a multimodal approach of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore the possible neurobiological mechanism of cognitive impairment in cancer patients, comparing the results with a group of noncancer controls. The second stage involved assigning CRCI patients into the acupuncture intervention group, while patients without CRCI were assigned into the cancer control group. The third stage was a postintervention assessment of neurocognitive function by the same set of neurocognitive tests at baseline. To explore the possible neurobiological basis of acupuncture for treating CRCI, this study also used a multimodal MRI approach to assess changes in brain structural connectivity, and neurochemical properties in patients at pre- and postacupuncture intervention. Results: This study found that the prevalence of cognitive impairment in Chinese gynecological cancer patients at diagnosis was 26.67%. When investigating the microstructural white matter in the brain, diffusion tensor imaging data in this study indicated that premorbid cognitive functioning (before clinical manifestations become evident) has already existed, as the global and local connectome properties in the entire patient group were lower than in the healthy control group. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, this study indicated there was a significant reduction of relative concentration of NAA (N-acetyl aspartate) in the left hippocampus, comparing these results with healthy controls. Regarding the effects of acupuncture on reducing CRCI, patients in the acupuncture group reported better neurocognitive test performance after matching for age, menopausal status, cancer stage, and chemotherapy regimen dosage. On a microstructural level, acupuncture’s ability to reduce CRCI may be attributed to a reduction in demyelination and an enhancement of the neuronal viability of white matter in the hippocampus. Conclusion: This pilot study indicates that acupuncture is a promising intervention in treating CRCI in gynecological cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy; however, it requires evaluation in larger randomized controlled studies to definitively assess its benefit. By using a multimodal imaging approach, this pilot study also provides novel insights into the neurobiological basis of cognitive impairment on the human brain that has been induced by cancer and/or its treatment.'},\n",

To study the efficacy of the Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) protocol in a BC survivor sample on quality of life, psychological well-being, fear of cancer recurrence, self-compassion, and compassion domains and mindfulness facets. Furthermore, enrollment, adherence, and satisfaction with the intervention were also analyzed. Methods. A randomized clinical trial was designed.

The methodology was informed by social constructionist grounded theory. Three of the women interviewed said they would use the term survivor to describe themselves, but most of the women felt it did not fit with their experiences. The accounts of those who accepted and rejected the survivor identity are explored, and subthemes in the latter are “survivor as somebody else” and “cancer's ongoing presence.” This article calls into question the basing of intervention strategies on the notion of the “cancer survivor,” and the assumption that younger women favour the survivor identity. Participants struggled with the demand to live up to the ideal of the survivor, which implied a high degree of agency where in reality, cancer was a disempowering experience.

Methods: Matched cohorts of breast cancer survivors who did and did not choose to supplement their breast cancer treatment with NO care within 2 years of diagnosis participated. NO users were identified through naturopathic doctors’ clinics and usual care (UC) controls with similar prognosis were identified through a cancer registry. The registry provided information about all participants’ age, race, ethnicity, marital status, stage of cancer at time of diagnosis, date of diagnosis, and use of conventional medical treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and endocrine therapy). Data of participants’ self-reported involvement in decision-making and HRQOL were collected at study enrollment and at 6-month follow-up. Results: At 6-month follow-up, the NO patients reported significantly more involvement in decision-making about care and better general health than did UC patients (P < .05).

Assessments of FCR and quality of life were completed by the breast cancer survivor pre-therapy, post-therapy, and at 6 and 12 months of post-therapy. In each treatment session, perceived control over FCR was assessed. A clinical nurse specialist participated in evaluation interviews. The patient’s perceived control over FCR increased during the therapy, and FCR severity declined to a non-clinical level. This improvement was still evident at the 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments and was supported by results for secondary and exploratory outcomes measures. FCR offers a great challenge for health care professionals due to the lack of effective treatment options. This case study shows how clinical FCR can be addressed with CBT and can contribute to the improvement of care for cancer survivors.'},\n",

We aimed to study the prevalence and determinants of dissatisfaction with cosmetic outcome after breast cancer surgery of Asian breast cancer survivors, and its association with patient-reported anxiety, depression, and quality of life. In a hospital-based cross-sectional study, 384 breast cancer survivors of at least 12 months after diagnosis completed questionnaires on satisfaction with cosmetic appearance, quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and anxiety and depression (HADS). Cumulative logit models were used to examine the adjusted association between dissatisfaction with cosmetic appearance and demographic and clinical characteristics. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test for associations between dissatisfaction with cosmetic appearance and patient-reported outcomes. Overall, 20% of women reported to be (very) dissatisfied with cosmetic appearance. Survivors of Chinese ethnicity were more likely dissatisfied with cosmetic appearance compared to Malay survivors (22% and 14% respectively, adjusted OR = 2.4, 95%CI: 1.4–3.9).

Acupuncture usage among BC survivors remains low with little known about the barriers to its utilization. We evaluated perceived barriers to acupuncture use among BC survivors and explored the sociodemographic variations of such barriers. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis at an urban academic cancer center on 593 postmenopausal women with a history of stage I-III hormone receptor-positive BC who were taking or had taken an aromatase inhibitor. We used the modified Attitudes and Beliefs about Complementary and Alternative Medicine instrument to evaluate patients’ perceived barriers to acupuncture. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine sociodemographic factors associated with perceived barrier scores. Results: The most common barriers were lack of knowledge about acupuncture (41.6%), concern for lack of insurance coverage (25.0%), cost (22.3%), and difficulty finding qualified acupuncturists (18.6%). Compared with whites, minority patients had higher perceived barriers to use acupuncture (β coefficient = 1.63, 95% confidence interval = 0.3-2.9, P = .013). Patients with lower education had higher barriers to use acupuncture (β coefficient = 4.23, 95% confidence interval = 3.0-5.4, P < .001) compared with patients with college education or above. Conclusion: Lack of knowledge and concerns for insurance coverage and cost are the common barriers to acupuncture use among BC survivors, especially among minority patients with lower education. Addressing these barriers may lead to more equitable access to acupuncture treatment for BC survivors from diverse backgrounds.'},\n",

With breast cancer patients and survivors being reported to experience a repertoire of symptoms that are detrimental to their quality of life, the development of breast cancer treatment strategies that are effective with minimal side effects is therefore required. Personalized medicine, the treatment process that is tailored to the individual needs of each patient, is recently gaining increasing attention for its prospect in the development of effective cancer treatment regimens. Indeed, recent studies have identified a number of genes and molecules that may be used as biomarkers for predicting drug response and severity of common cancer-associated symptoms. These would provide useful clues not only for the determination of the optimal drug choice/dosage to be used in personalized treatment, but also for the identification of gene or molecular targets for the development of novel symptom management strategies, which ultimately would lead to the development of more personalized therapies for effective cancer treatment. In this article, recent studies that would provide potential new options for personalized therapies for breast cancer patients and survivors are reviewed.

Occupational health professionals might improve work-related outcomes by bridging the gap between sick-listed employees’ levels of functioning and work demands. To aid them in this task, this review explored the association between functional impairments and work-related outcomes in breast cancer survivors. Methods Publications from January 2000–March 2016 were identified through five online databases (i.e. Pubmed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library). Quantitative and qualitative studies were included if they focused on functional impairments and work-related outcomes in breast cancer survivors. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and performed quality assessment. Results The search identified 998 studies, of which 20 studies met eligibility criteria. Impairments in physical functioning negatively affected return to work (RTW) and work ability in quantitative and qualitative studies. Studies measuring cognitive functioning with tests found no association with work-related outcomes, whereas the results of studies using self-reported measures were ambiguous. Social functioning was less commonly investigated and findings differed across work-related outcomes. Emotional functioning was not associated with work-related outcomes in quantitative studies, while in qualitative studies feelings such as insecurity were described as influencing RTW. Conclusions Functional impairments can severely hamper work participation in breast cancer survivors. This provides important opportunities for occupational health professionals to enhance RTW in breast cancer survivors, such as adequately addressing illness perceptions and work expectations.

Methods: We explored this issue in a mixed methods study with 53 adult survivors of 3 cancers (breast, prostate, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), living in Maryland. Participants provided three 24-hour dietary recalls, and results were used to classify respondents on 2 metrics of healthful eating (the Healthy Eating Index 2010, and a 9-item index based on current dietary recommendations). Recalls were also used to guide in-depth qualitative discussions with participants regarding self-assessment of dietary behaviors, healthful eating, and diet’s importance in cancer prevention and survivorship. Results: Survivors following a more healthful diet were more likely to be female, have greater socioeconomic resources, more years since diagnosis, normal weight, and no smoking history. Qualitative discussions revealed a more nuanced understanding of dietary strategies among healthful eaters, as well as the importance of household members in dietary decision making. Discussion: Most survivors had received little nutrition counseling as part of their cancer care, highlighting the importance of holistic, household-oriented nutrition education for maintaining health among long-term cancer survivors.'},\n",

This was a descriptive cross-sectional study with 98 women survivors of breast cancer, who were registered with the SIMMON (Integrated Synergies to Improve Oncological Management in Colombia) Foundation. Body weight, height, and waist circumference (WC) were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Body composition (percentage of fat and muscle mass) was evaluated via four-pole bioelectrical impedance analysis. Sarcopenia was defined as low muscle mass plus low grip strength or low gait speed (European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criteria). A “causal” mediation analysis with the Baron & Kenny procedure (PROCESS® macro, Columbus, OH, USA) was used to explore variables related to sarcopenia. Analyses were performed with the IBM SPSS 21 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The significance level of the results obtained in the hypothesis contrast was p < 0.05. The mean age of the sample was 65.5 ± 5.9 years, with a BMI of 27.8 ± 4.7 kg/m2. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 22.4%. Linear regression models suggest a partial mediation of anthropometric parameters (body mass, body mass index and waist circumference) in the association between handgrip strength and muscle mass. In conclusion, one in every five women survivors of breast cancer had sarcopenia. The findings seem to emphasize the importance of obesity prevention in women survivors of breast cancer, suggesting that high handgrip strength may not relate closely to greater muscle mass and therefore would not exclude the risk of sarcopenia.'},\n",

Secondary outcomes were symptom experience, health status, coping capacity, mindfulness, posttraumatic growth, and immune status. This RTC assigned 166 women with breast cancer to one of three groups: MBSR (8 weekly group sessions of MBSR), active controls (self‐instructing MBSR) and non‐MBSR. The primary outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcome measures were: Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, SF‐36, Sense of Coherence, Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire, and Posttraumatic Growth Index. Blood samples were analyzed using flow cytometry for NK‐cell activity (FANKIA) and lymphocyte phenotyping; concentrations of cytokines were determined in sera using commercial high sensitivity IL‐6 and IL‐8 ELISA (enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay) kits. Results provide evidence for beneficial effects of MBSR on psychological and biological responses.

Therefore, interventions need to be developed to improve the bone strength and balance ability of breast cancer survivors. This cross-sectional exploratory study aimed to compare the bone mineral density (BMD), balance performance, balance self-efficacy, and number of falls between breast cancer survivors who practiced qigong, breast cancer survivors who did not practice qigong, and healthy individuals. Methods: The study included 40 breast cancer survivors with more than 3 months of qigong experience, 17 breast cancer survivors with no qigong experience, and 36 healthy controls. All the participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans to measure their lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and total radius BMDs. The participants also underwent a timed one-leg stand test to measure their single-leg standing balance. The participants’ balance self-efficacy was assessed using the activities-specific balance confidence scale, and the number of falls experienced by each participant was assessed in a face-to-face interview. Results: The lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and total radius BMDs were similar between the 3 groups (P > .05). The breast cancer-qigong group outperformed the breast cancer-control group by 27.3% when they performed the one-leg stand test on a foam surface (P = .025), and they also had a higher balance self-efficacy score (P = .006).

To date, there have been very few attempts to develop accurate and efficient computational tools that could be used in the clinical environment for pre-operative planning and oncoplastic breast surgery assessment. Moreover, from the breast cancer research perspective, there has been very little effort to model complex mechano-biological processes involved in wound healing. We address this by providing an integrated numerical framework that can simulate the therapeutic effects of BCT over the extended period of treatment and recovery. A validated, three-dimensional, multiscale finite element procedure that simulates breast tissue deformations and physiological wound healing is presented. In the proposed methodology, a partitioned, continuum-based mathematical model for tissue recovery and angiogenesis, and breast tissue deformation is considered. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme is illustrated through patient-specific representative examples. Wound repair and contraction numerical analyses of real MRI-derived breast geometries are investigated, and the final predictions of the breast shape are validated against post-operative follow-up optical surface scans from four patients. Mean (standard deviation) breast surface distance errors in millimetres of 3.1 (±3.1), 3.2 (±2.4), 2.8 (±2.7) and 4.1 (±3.3) were obtained, demonstrating the ability of the surgical simulation tool to predict, pre-operatively, the outcome of BCT to clinically useful accuracy.'},\n",

One‐on‐one interviews with medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists in Wisconsin were conducted (n\\xa0=\\xa035) and transcribed. Data analysis was performed using an inductive approach to content analysis. Oncologist‐perceived barriers included: PCP's level of experience with cancer care; Lack of PCP comfort in providing survivorship care; Existing demands on PCPs' time; Patient preference for oncology‐led survivorship care. Oncologists described familiarity and trust in individual PCPs as factors that could mitigate barriers and lead to increased PCP involvement in survivorship care. Although a number of perceived barriers to PCP participation in survivorship were identified by Wisconsin oncologists, our findings support the direction of ongoing initiatives to facilitate PCP involvement. Our findings also suggest that early PCP involvement in survivorship may increase PCP comfort and patients' trust in PCPs in this role. The identified barrier most challenging to address may be the limited capacity of the current primary care system to manage follow‐up for breast cancer survivors.\"},\n",

Methods. 40 BC women, aged 35-70 years, were randomized into an intervention (IG) and a control group (CG). IG performed a 3 month of aerobic exercise. At baseline and after 3 months, the following parameters were evaluated both for IG and CG: anthropometric and body composition measurements, energy expenditure and motion level; sleep parameters (Actual Sleep Time-AST, Actual Wake Time-AWT, Sleep Efficiency-SE, Sleep Latency-SL, Mean Activity Score-MAS, Movement and Fragmentation Index-MFI and Immobility Time-IT) and activity level circadian rhythm using the Actigraph Actiwatch. Results. The CG showed a deterioration of sleep, whereas the IG showed a stable pattern. In the CG the SE, AST and IT decreased and the AWT, SL, MAS and MFI increased. In the IG, the SE, IT, AWT, SL, and MAS showed no changes and AST and MFI showed a less pronounced change in the IG than in the CG.

To explore racial/ethnic differences in objective sleep disturbances among BCSs and their relationship with self-reported symptoms. Intervention/Methods. Sleep disturbance and symptoms were measured using actigraphy for 72 hours and self-reported questionnaires, respectively, among 79 BCSs. Analysis of covariance, Pearson's correlation, and multivariate regression were used to analyze data. Results. Sixty (75.9%) participants listed their ethnicity as white, non-Hispanic and 19 (24.1%) as minority. Total sleep time was 395.9 minutes for white BCSs compared to 330.4 minutes for minority BCSs. Significant correlations were seen between sleep onset latency (SOL) and depression, SOL and fatigue, and sleep efficiency (SE) and fatigue among minority BCSs. Among white BCSs, significant correlations were seen between SE and pain and wake after sleep onset (WASO) and pain. The association between depression and SOL and fatigue and SOL appeared to be stronger in minority BCSs than white BCSs. Conclusions. Results indicate that white BCSs slept longer than minority BCSs, and race/ethnicity modified the effect of depression and fatigue on SOL, respectively. Implications for Practice.

Although NIR was first applied to breast diaphanography more than 70 years ago, quantitative optical methods employing time- or frequency-domain 'photon migration' technologies have only recently been used for breast imaging. Because their performance is not limited by mammographic density, optical methods can provide new insight regarding tissue functional changes associated with the appearance, progression, and treatment of breast cancer, particularly for younger women and high-risk subjects who may not benefit from conventional imaging methods. This paper reviews the principles of diffuse optics and describes the development of broadband DOS for quantitatively measuring the optical and physiological properties of thick tissues. Clinical results are shown highlighting the sensitivity of diffuse optics to malignant breast tumors in 12 pre-menopausal subjects ranging in age from 30 to 39 years and a patient undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer. Significant contrast was observed between normal and tumor regions of tissue for deoxy-hemoglobin (p = 0.005), oxy-hemoglobin (p = 0.002), water (p = 0.014), and lipids (p = 0.0003). Tissue hemoglobin saturation was not found to be a reliable parameter for distinguishing between tumor and normal tissues. Optical data were converted into a tissue optical index that decreased 50% within 1 week in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These results suggest a potential role for diffuse optics as a bedside monitoring tool that could aid the development of new strategies for individualized patient care.\"},\n",

Levels of MMP-9 expression below the cut-off point were more frequently observed in larger (P = 0.014), invasive ductal histologic (P = 0.037), progesterone receptor (PR)-negative and PR-strong positive tumours (P< 0.001), as well as samples belonging to patients with stage III-IV disease (P = 0.009) and age 45–55 years (P = 0.011). In univariate analysis, node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors positive for MMP-9 had a considerable reduction in risk for relapse (RR = 0.45;P = 0.039) or death (RR = 0.32;P = 0.009). Multivariate analysis indicated that MMP-9 status was an independent favourable predictor of OS (RR = 0.47;P = 0.034) in node-negative but not in node-positive patients. Our results suggest that MMP-9 may be an independent favourable prognostic factor in node-negative breast cancer patients. The overexpression of MMP-9 in breast cancer may be also used as a marker to subdivide node negative breast cancer patients in order to determine the optimal treatment modality. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com'},\n",

       "  'passage_text': \"Chemotherapy is widely used in the management of patients with advanced breast cancer. However, a considerable proportion of patients experience toxic side effects without gaining benefit. This study aimed to elicit oncologists' views of the goals of chemotherapy for patients with advanced breast cancer and to elicit which factors are important in decisions to recommend chemotherapy to such patients. 30 oncologists underwent a semi-structured interview to examine their views of 5 goals of chemotherapy and of various disease, treatment and patient-related factors that might influence decisions to offer treatment. The clinicians also made decisions regarding treatment in relation to a hypothetical patient scenario under varying clinical conditions. Relief of symptoms and improvement of activity were rated as the most valuable and achievable goals of treatment. The patient's performance status, frailty and their wishes regarding treatment were the most important patient-related factors in determining decision-making. The most important disease/treatment-related factors were pace of the disease, previous poor response to chemotherapy, co-existing symptoms and concurrent medical conditions. The hypothetical scenario revealed that co-existing medical conditions, adverse previous response, increased age and depression would decrease the likelihood of recommending chemotherapy, whereas key symptoms (e.g. breathlessness) and the patient's goals would increase the likelihood. The findings suggest that British oncologists primarily aim to improve patients' physical function, although subjective factors, such as a patient's desire for anti-cancer treatment and their future goals, also influence decisions to offer treatment. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com\"}]"

Following a systematic review of published studies and a structured appraisal process, recommendations were developed to guide physical therapists and other health care clinicians in their intervention selection. Overall, clinical practice recommendations were formulated based on the evidence for each intervention and were assigned a grade based on the strength of the evidence. The evidence for each specific intervention was synthesized and appraised by lymphedema stage, when the information was available. In an effort to make recommendations clinically applicable, they were presented by modality throughout the care trajectory. Methodology and research populations varied significantly across studies, and it will be important for future research to use standardized definitions for participant characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and interventions.'}"

       "'This cross-sectional study is aimed at assessing the quality of life in a cohort of breast cancer patients at the Oncology Department, King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), King Abdulaziz University (KAU), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (SA), and to differentiate QoL among different groups. Mean time since diagnosis was 3.97±1.90 years. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires—Core30 and BR23 (EORTC QLQ-C30 & BR23) were used to assess QoL in breast cancer survivors. ANOVA and independent t-test (parametric tests) were used for the categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests used for non-parametric tests. Linear regression analysis was done to measure predictors’ significance and to calculate the coefficient of determination. Two hundred and eighty-four patients completed the survey. Global health status and functional scales, in most of the domains, were high, while symptom scales were moderate-to-low for most items, showing better QoL. Insomnia and fatigue were the most disturbing symptoms. Patients exhibited higher scores for body image and future perspective, while the least score is for sexual functioning. Global health, physical functioning, and role functioning were better in the age group ≤50 years (p<0.05). Premenopausal and perimenopausal patients showed a better level of functioning as compared to postmenopausal patients (p = 0.001). Premenopausal patients scored higher for sexual enjoyment, as compared to peri- and post-menopausal patients (p = 0.04). Systemic therapy side effects were more evident in the breast conservative surgery group. Predictors explained 8% of the variation in Physical functioning (R-squared = 0.08). A predictor that had a remarkable influence on physical functioning, as compared to the other predictors in the model, was menopausal status (P = 0.02). So, it was concluded that the breast cancer patients visiting our institute had a better quality of life regarding overall global health status as well as functional and symptom scales. Some issues, for instance, fatigue, insomnia, hair loss, and others, warrant good supportive therapy.'"
